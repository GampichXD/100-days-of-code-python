# CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
# Old programmer want to make web pages look good but they limited to HTML.
# CSS allows them to style their web pages.

# How to add CSS?
# 1. Inline CSS - using the style attribute in HTML elements.
# 2. Internal CSS - using the <style> element in the <head> section of the HTML document.
# 3. External CSS - using a separate CSS file and linking it to the HTML document using the <link> element.
# 4. CSS Frameworks - using pre-defined CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.
# 5. CSS Preprocessors - using pre-processors like SASS, LESS, etc. to write CSS in a more structured way.
# 6. CSS-in-JS - using JavaScript to write CSS styles in a more dynamic way.
# 7. CSS Modules - using CSS modules to write CSS in a more modular way.

# inline = element
# internal = webpage
# external = file style.css

# CSS Selectors
# Element Selector - selects all elements of a specific type.
# Class Selector - selects all elements with a specific class. (.) dot
# ID Selector - selects the element with a specific ID. (#) hash
# Difference between class and ID selector - class can be used multiple times in a webpage but ID can be used only once.
# Attribute Selector - selects elements with a specific attribute. p[attribute=value]
# Universal Selector - selects all elements in the document. (*)
