# Version Control
# In this project, we will create a simple version control system that allows users to track changes to their files.
# Working Directory -git add> Staging Area -git commit> Git Repository -git remote & git push> Remote Repository
# git checkout --> throwback last version
# git remote add <name> <url> --> add remote repository
# git push <name> <branch> --> push to remote repository
# Main Branch --> 

# .gitignore
# template : https://github.com/github/gitignore
# git rm --cached {<file> / -r .} --> remove file from staging area
# git clone <url> --> clone remote repository ==> build on existing project, improve your own version, read other people's code, contribute to open source projects
# Branching and Merging
# git branch <branch_name> --> create a new branch
# Main , Feature, Bugfix, Release, Hotfix


# Additional Challenges
# Cherry picking
# git cherry-pick <commit_hash> --> apply changes from a specific commit to the current branch
# Git Rebase
# git rebase <branch_name> --> apply changes from one branch to another

# Forking and Pull Requests
# Owner and Collaborator can write access
# Contributor and Everyone else just read-only access
# Pull Request --> request to merge changes from one branch to another
# git pull request <branch_name> --> create a pull request
